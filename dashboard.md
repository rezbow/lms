For a staff dashboard of a library management system, I recommend displaying key statistics that give an at-a-glance overview of the library's activity and status. Here are some essential data points and metrics:

ðŸ“Š General Library Statistics

    Total number of books: This is a fundamental metric. You could break it down further into different categories, such as fiction, non-fiction, or specific genres.

    Total number of members: A simple count of all registered library patrons.

    Active members: The number of members who have borrowed a book within a specified period (e.g., the last year).

    Total number of unique books: The number of different titles available in the library, as opposed to the total number of physical copies.

    Overdue books count: A critical metric for staff. Displaying the number of books currently overdue and maybe a link to a detailed list of those books is very useful.

ðŸ“ˆ Recent Activity

    Recently borrowed books: A list or count of books checked out in the last 24 hours or the current day.

    Recently returned books: A similar list for books that have just been returned.

    New members: Displaying the names or a count of new users who have registered recently.

ðŸ“š Book and Member Analytics

    Most popular books: A list of the books that have been borrowed most frequently over a specific period (e.g., the last month or year). . This helps in identifying high-demand titles.

    Most popular genres: A breakdown of the most frequently borrowed genres. This can guide future purchasing decisions.

    Member activity breakdown: A visualization showing the borrowing habits of members, for example, the number of books borrowed per member per month.

ðŸš¨ Alerts and Notifications

    Low stock alerts: Notifications for books that have only one or two copies left and are in high demand.

    Upcoming overdue books: A list of books that are due back in the next day or two. This allows staff to proactively send reminders.

    Hold requests: The number of books that currently have a hold request from a member.
These statistics provide a comprehensive view of the library's operations, helping staff manage resources effectively and serve patrons better.
